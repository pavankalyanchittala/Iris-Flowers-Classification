## 3) Iris Flowers Classification : Predict the different species of flowers on the length of there petals and sepals

![Iris Flowers Classification (ML)- Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/pavankalyanchittala/Iris-Flowers-Classification/assets/117903644/15e6042d-6d2b-4427-8701-7c99d9cb17d7)

The dataset, I taken from Kaggle contains the Iris flower dataset that use for this  project. This dataset likely includes measurements of the length and width of the sepals and petals of different species of Iris flowers, including Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. By utilizing a classification algorithm, you can train a machine learning model on this dataset to predict the species of Iris flower based on these measurements.

To get started, you can download the dataset from the provided link and explore its contents. Make sure to preprocess the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any, and splitting it into training and testing sets. Then, you can train a classification model using the training data and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Remember to perform feature selection or engineering if necessary to improve the model's accuracy. Once the model is trained and evaluated, you can use it to predict the species of Iris flower for new, unseen data.
